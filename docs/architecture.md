# Architecture

suss extracts **behavioral summaries** from source code — structured descriptions of every execution path through a function, mapping *conditions* to *outputs*. This document explains how the pieces fit together.

## The core idea

Most analysis tools describe *structure* (a function has these parameters, returns this type). suss describes *behavior*: "when `user` is null, this handler throws 404; otherwise it returns 200 with a `User` shape". Behavioral summaries are language- and framework-agnostic JSON, so downstream tools (contract checkers, doc generators, test enumerators, impact analyzers) can operate on them without caring whether the source was TypeScript, Python, or anything else.

## Data flow

```

    │  Language Adapter (@suss/adapter-typescript)

```

The split between adapter and extractor is deliberate. The extractor never sees an AST node — it works on `RawCodeStructure`, a plain data shape. This means:

1. **The extractor is trivially testable** with hand-crafted input. Tests run in milliseconds, no compiler involved.
2. **Adding a new language** means writing a new adapter that produces `RawCodeStructure`. The extractor doesn't change.
3. **Framework pack authors** never touch the adapter or extractor — they describe patterns declaratively.

## The vocabulary

These terms are used consistently across the codebase. Most are illustrated with a running example: this ts-rest handler.

```typescript
// The running example for this section
export const getUser = async ({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) => {
  const user = await db.findById(params.id);
  if (!user) {
    return { status: 404, body: { error: "not found" } };
  }
  return { status: 200, body: user };
};
```

**Code unit**: a callable piece of code (handler, loader, component, resolver, consumer). The atomic unit of analysis. Every code unit has a **kind** that determines its behavioral model. In the example above, `getUser` is a code unit of kind `"handler"`.

**Boundary**: an identifiable point of interaction (REST endpoint, GraphQL operation, message queue topic). Boundaries are where behavioral contracts matter. For `getUser`, the boundary is `GET /users/:id` — the code unit is *bound* to that boundary via the framework's registration mechanism.

**Terminal**: a point in a code unit where observable output is produced. Terminals are framework-specific but the *output type* is universal. In the running example there are two terminals — the highlighted lines below:

```typescript
if (!user) {
  return { status: 404, body: { error: "not found" } };  // ← terminal 1
}
return { status: 200, body: user };                       // ← terminal 2
```

Other terminal shapes: `res.status(400).json(...)` in Express, `throw httpErrorJson(404)` in React Router, a JSX return in a React component.

**Transition**: `(conditions → output, effects)`. The atomic unit of behavioral description. A code unit's full behavior is its set of transitions. `getUser` has two:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "getUser:0",
    "conditions": [{ "type": "truthinessCheck", "subject": <user>, "negated": true }],
    "output": { "type": "response", "statusCode": { "type": "literal", "value": 404 }, ... },
    "isDefault": false
  },
  {
    "id": "getUser:1",
    "conditions": [],
    "output": { "type": "response", "statusCode": { "type": "literal", "value": 200 }, ... },
    "isDefault": true
  }
]
```

**Predicate**: a structured condition gating a transition. Has a **subject** (what value is tested), a **test** (nullness, equality, etc.), and composes into `and`/`or`/`negation`. The source expression `!user` becomes:

```json
{
  "type": "truthinessCheck",
  "subject": { "type": "dependency", "name": "db.findById", "accessChain": [] },
  "negated": true
}
```

When the extractor can't decompose an expression (complex function calls, dynamic computation), it falls back to an `opaque` predicate that preserves the source text.

**Subject / ValueRef**: a reference to a value with an *origin* (parameter, dependency call, import, context) and a *path* (property access chain). Shallow on purpose: identifies what's being tested without trying to understand its full semantics. A deeper example — `container.repository.lastAnalyzedCommitHash`, where `container` came from `await prisma.containerV2.findUnique(...)`:

```json
{
  "type": "derived",
  "from": {
    "type": "derived",
    "from": { "type": "dependency", "name": "prisma.containerV2.findUnique", "accessChain": [] },
    "derivation": { "type": "propertyAccess", "property": "repository" }
  },
  "derivation": { "type": "propertyAccess", "property": "lastAnalyzedCommitHash" }
}
```

Two predicates that test the same subject — on different sides of a service boundary — should be recognizable as referring to the same thing. That's why the shape is structural, not a raw string.

**Output**: what a terminal produces. One of: `response`, `throw`, `render`, `return`, `delegate`, `emit`, or `void`. The `response` variant from the running example:

```json
{
  "type": "response",
  "statusCode": { "type": "literal", "value": 200 },
  "body": { "type": "ref", "name": "User" },
  "headers": {}
}
```

**Gap**: a case the code unit doesn't explicitly handle. First-class in the summary, not an error. If the declared contract for `getUser` says the endpoint can return `200 | 404 | 500`, but the handler never actually produces 500, that's a gap:

```json
{
  "type": "unhandledCase",
  "consequence": "frameworkDefault",
  "description": "Declared response 500 is never produced by the handler"
}
```

Gaps run both directions: *declared but not produced* (as above) and *produced but not declared* (contract violation).

**Declared contract**: a machine-readable behavioral declaration authored alongside the implementation. For `getUser`, a ts-rest contract:

```typescript
const contract = c.router({
  getUser: {
    method: "GET",
    path: "/users/:id",
    pathParams: z.object({ id: z.string() }),
    responses: {
      200: UserSchema,
      404: ErrorSchema,
      500: ErrorSchema,
    },
  },
});
```

The extractor reads both the declaration and the implementation, and the checker compares them.

**Framework pack**: declarative patterns describing how to find code units, what terminals look like, and how inputs are delivered for a specific framework. They are data, not code — the adapter interprets them.

```typescript
tsRestFramework(): FrameworkPack {
  return {
    name: "ts-rest",
    languages: ["typescript"],
    discovery: [{ kind: "handler", match: { type: "registrationCall", ... } }],
    terminals: [{ kind: "response", match: { type: "returnShape",
                  requiredProperties: ["status", "body"] }, extraction: { ... } }],
    contractReading: { ... },
    inputMapping: { type: "destructuredObject", knownProperties: { ... } },
  };
}
```

**Confidence**: how much of a code unit's behavior was structurally analyzed vs. opaque. Computed as the ratio of opaque predicates to total predicates, bucketed into `high` / `medium` / `low`. Degrades gracefully when the extractor can't decompose something, so downstream consumers can treat low-confidence summaries with appropriate skepticism.

## Package layout

```
@suss/behavioral-ir          zero deps, types only. Install this to consume summaries.
    │
@suss/extractor              assembly engine + FrameworkPack interface. No AST access.
    │
    ├─ @suss/adapter-typescript     ts-morph-based extraction
    │
    ├─ @suss/framework-ts-rest      declarative patterns
    ├─ @suss/framework-react-router
    └─ @suss/framework-express
    │
@suss/cli                    thin wrapper
```

Dependency rules (enforced by the layout):

- `@suss/behavioral-ir` — zero dependencies. This is what downstream consumers install.
- `@suss/extractor` — depends only on the IR. Defines `RawCodeStructure` and `FrameworkPack`. Never imports ts-morph or any compiler API.
- `@suss/adapter-typescript` — depends on IR, extractor, ts-morph. This is the heavyweight package.
- `@suss/framework-*` packs — depend only on `@suss/extractor` (for the `FrameworkPack` type). They're data, not logic.
- `@suss/cli` — depends on everything; dynamically imports the adapter so CLI startup doesn't pay the ts-morph cost unless extraction actually runs.

## The extraction algorithm

For each code unit, the adapter runs four independently testable steps:

1. **Terminal discovery** — use framework patterns to find all AST nodes that produce observable output.
2. **Ancestor branch collection** — walk upward from each terminal to the function root, recording branching constructs (`if`, `switch`, `try/catch`, ternary, `&&`/`||`).
3. **Early return detection** — scan sibling statements before the terminal; any `if (cond) return` contributes an implicit negative predicate to the terminal.
4. **Condition expression parsing** — decompose each condition AST node into a structured `Predicate`, resolving subjects via the symbol table. Fall back to `opaque` when decomposition fails.

The four functions compose in step 5 (**assembly**): for each terminal, concatenate its early-return conditions + ancestor-branch conditions, pair with the terminal's output data, and produce a `Transition`.

## Why `RawCodeStructure` exists

The adapter produces `RawCodeStructure` (plain data). The extractor consumes it and produces `BehavioralSummary`. You might ask: why not skip the intermediate shape and produce `BehavioralSummary` directly from the adapter?

Three reasons:

1. **Testability.** `assembleSummary(raw)` is a pure function that can be tested with hand-crafted input. No fixtures, no compiler, no files. The extractor test suite runs in <50ms.
2. **Logic centralization.** Gap detection, confidence assessment, predicate normalization, and opaque-wrapping all live in one place. Language adapters don't re-implement them.
3. **Contributor isolation.** A framework pack author never touches adapter code. An adapter bug doesn't affect the extractor. The extractor doesn't care what language the raw structure came from.

## Framework packs are data, not code

A framework pack is a `FrameworkPack` object describing patterns:

- **Discovery patterns** — how to find code units (`namedExport` for React Router loaders, `registrationCall` for ts-rest handlers, `decorator` for FastAPI, `fileConvention` for Next.js)
- **Terminal patterns** — what counts as output (`returnShape` for `{ status, body }`, `parameterMethodCall` for `res.json()`, `throwExpression` for `throw httpErrorJson(...)`)
- **Binding extraction** — how to derive the HTTP method and path (from a registration call argument, from the filename, from a contract, or as a literal)
- **Contract reading** — if the framework has declared contracts, how to find and read them
- **Input mapping** — how inputs reach the handler (`singleObjectParam`, `positionalParams`, `destructuredObject`) with role annotations

The adapter interprets these patterns against a language's AST. This means adding a new framework with a similar pattern to an existing one (e.g., Fastify after Express) is mostly copy-edit work.

## Degradation strategy

Static analysis of real codebases is always imperfect. suss handles this explicitly rather than pretending it doesn't:

- **Opaque predicates** — when the adapter can't decompose a condition expression, it preserves the source text and marks the predicate `opaque`. Downstream tools handle these honestly.
- **Gaps** — cases the code unit doesn't handle (declared-but-not-produced, produced-but-not-declared, uncaught exceptions, fall-through branches) are first-class output, not errors.
- **Confidence levels** (`high` / `medium` / `low`) — computed from the ratio of opaque to structured predicates. A summary with 80% opaque conditions is labeled "low confidence" so consumers can treat it with appropriate skepticism.
- **Graceful dependency resolution** — in-project code gets full extraction; typed external dependencies get type info; untyped ones are opaque. No configuration needed.

## What's deliberately not here

- **A full control flow graph.** suss identifies terminals and their gating conditions. It doesn't build a CFG or do data flow analysis. This is a cost/value tradeoff — a CFG would capture more but costs orders of magnitude more in complexity.
- **A cross-boundary checker.** Comparing provider/consumer summaries is downstream work. suss produces the inputs; a separate tool will consume them.
- **Runtime tracing.** Everything is static. No instrumentation, no production data.
- **Semantic understanding of dependency calls.** When the extractor sees `await db.findById(id)`, it knows the subject is `"the result of db.findById"`. It doesn't know what Prisma's `findById` actually does. That's fine — cross-boundary comparison only needs subjects to be *stable*, not *semantically understood*.
